# Hospital-Admission-Analysis

üè• Project Overview:

In this project I analyzed over 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care data provided by 130 US hospitals, focusing on diabetic inpatient encounters. The dataset itself was taken from kaggle and sheds light on patient demographics, medical outcomes, readmissions and medications prescribed. Using SQL, I tried to extract data to analyze key metrics that would help drive hospital performance such as:
- Exploring trends in the hospital stay duration.
- Analyzing patient distribution based on readmission status.
- Exploring correlations between lab procedures and length of stay.
- Identifying specialties with high procedure counts.
- Tracking patients with multiple hospital readmissions.
- Investigating the possibility of racial bias within the amount of procedures patients undergo.
